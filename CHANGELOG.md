## Version History

### [1.0.0] - 2025-10-08

Initial release with six complete implementations

## Notes

This project started as a simple matplotlib visualization and evolved into a comprehensive showcase of data visualization across multiple programming languages and tools. The goal is to demonstrate that there's no single "best" way to visualize data - each tool has its strengths and ideal use cases.
